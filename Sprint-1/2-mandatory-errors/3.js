// The last4Digits variable should store the last 4 digits of cardNumber
// However, the code isn't working
// Before running the code, make and explain a prediction about why the code won't work
// Then run the code and see what error it gives.
// Consider: Why does it give this error? Is this what I predicted? If not, what's different?
// Then try updating the expression last4Digits is assigned to, in order to get the correct value


//It won't run because slice only works with arrays and strings. It doesn't work on integers.
//Since the slice only works with arrays and strings, I did convert into a string before getting the last 4 digits.
